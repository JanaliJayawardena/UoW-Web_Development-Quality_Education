        <ul>
          <li><h3>Home Page + Template + Nav</h3></li>
          <li>In my capacity as the home page developer, I have concentrated on making the design both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. The website's identity and brand are established by the logo, which is shown prominently on the home page. Furthermore, in order to communicate the goal and dedication to sustainability, I have included the mission statement, which is in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. With its hover effects and active page indications, the CSS-designed navigation bar makes it easy to navigate to different areas of the website and improves user experience. In addition, I've added links to the four content pages, which are interactive and interestingly displayed to entice visitors to explore the site's abundance of material.</li>
          <li><h3>Feedback Form</h3></li>
          <li>My main goal has been to provide an intuitive user experience that promotes interaction and input from users. Users may easily and quickly fill out the form by providing their name, email address, rating, and comments in the user-friendly input areas. Data integrity has been ensured via the implementation of validation tests, together with clear error messages and visual cues to help users fix any incomplete or incorrect data. I've also included preview and edit features so that people may check and make changes to their feedback before submitting it. A confirmation message confirming receipt of the user's insightful remarks is shown once a submission is successful.</li>
          <li><h3>Content Page about Teacher Training and Professional Development</h3></li>
          <li>On the "Content Page about Teacher Training and Professional Development," I have concentrated on emphasizing the value of continuous professional development for teachers. The page explores the significance of ongoing professional development and how it might improve student learning outcomes and teacher effectiveness. I've divided the material up into several sections that address subjects including the newest approaches to teaching, how to manage the classroom, and how technology may be used in the classroom. I've included internal links all around the website to make it simple for visitors to move between parts and provide a smooth, user-friendly experience. The goal of the material is to give educators useful knowledge and tools to help them advance professionally and, in turn, create a more engaging learning environment for students.</li>
